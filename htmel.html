            <h7>First aid at 1-1-3: Prototype to enhance first aid knowledge </h7>
            <p> I collaborated with a team of five designers on this student project to develop a high fidelity prototype aimed at helping our user group to strengthen their <strong>first aid knowledge</strong>.
                By following a iterative design process we created a tangible interactive prototype, where we combined Arduino with participatory design to develop a desirable object 
                <strong>for</strong> our user group, <strong>with</strong> our user group.
                <br><br>The research question was <strong>"How can we enhance first aid knowledge among parents with immigrant backgrounds from Afghanistan?"</strong>

                    <h6>Process</h6>
                    <p> 
                        Duration of the project was four months which was divided into five iterations.
                        We worked agile in teams, combining some of the flexible aspects of Kanban together with aspects of Scrum to best fit the strict deadlines and goals. 
                        We did this project spring 2020 during the Covid-19 lock-down, which limited the access to our sources  - so we had to get creative with what we had!

                    <p> 
                        In this project, my primary responsibilities involved developing the prototype including the tecnhnical aspects with Arduino, as well as testing and evaluation with users.
                        Additionally, I was in charge of planning and writing both the project report and co-writing the technical report.

                            <h3>Issue</h3>
                            <p> Although first aid is a fundamental skill that everyone should master, 
                                emergency situations can induce uncertainty, 
                                leading to valuable time lost. Our goal is to <strong>decrease the uncertainty</strong>  associated with performing first aid and 
                                <strong>enhance itâ€™s efficiency.</strong></p>
                            
                            <h3>User group</h3>
                            <p>According to forskning.no, families with minority languages have poorer knowledge of first aid and prevention 
                                of injuries and accidents compared to Norwegian-speaking families. 
                                Therefore, we chose to focus on immigrants, specifically narrowing our attention to <strong>parents with immigrant backgrounds from Afghanistan.</strong>
                                 We saw this as a relevant topic for this target group, and we had access to this user group.</p>
    
                            <h3>Technical aspect</h3>
                            <p>
                                Arduino UNO were used to make his prototype <strong>tangible</strong>, 
                                enabling it to signal using LEDs. This was achieved through the integration of buttons and sound features connected to a rescue doll.

                            <h3> Evaluation during the design process</h3>
                            <p>For each iteration of our prototyping process, we conducted <strong>evaluations with users</strong> and adjusted the design of the 
                                prototype according to the feedback received. This approach ensured that we were consistently working towards a final prototype 
                                that genuinely met the users' needs and desires.

                                <p> We conducted semi-structured interviews and observations to acquire a better understanding of the <strong> users' challenges and habits</strong> in first aid training.
                                    We then started the data analysis by transcribing the interviews followed by methodically creating an affinity diagram to organize and categorize the subjects

                                    <br><br> <strong>What did we find?</strong> 
                                    <br>Cultural Understanding and Training Needs: We discovered that Afghan culture typically does not emphasize first aid education, leading to a lack of <strong>familarity and practice</strong> among Afghan immigrants.
                                   <br><br> Practical Training and Simplification: Our analysis indicated the necessity for practical, <strong>hands-on first aid training</strong> that is straightforward and specifically tailored to meet the users's needs. 
                                    This approach aims to make life-saving first aid more approachable and less daunting, enhancing <strong>confidence and preparedness </strong>to administer first aid in emergency situations.

                                <h4> Iteration 2 - exploration + prototyping </h4>
                                In our design process, the first prototype concept of a board game aimed at teaching first aid to immigrant families was not well-received due to
                                <strong>cultural unfamiliarity</strong> with board games and a focus on appearance over function.
                                <br><br>Based on this feedback, we developed the second prototype inspired by Rescue Anne, a practical first aid training doll for CPR, which was more positively received 
                                 for its <strong>approach to teaching </strong>first aid, though users preferred simpler instructions over complex scenarios.
                                 We therefore went on with this prototype to the next iteration.

                                <p>Building on the second low-fidelity prototype, we developed "First aid on 1-1-3," 
                                    a solution consisting of cards with images of first aid actions on one side and simple Norwegian explanations on the other,
                                    supplemented by a checklist and traffic light system to indicate completed steps. 

                                    <br><br><strong>Usability testing</strong> with a cushion as a substitute for a real person (advised by Red Cross volunteers) showed users understood the concept and appreciated the addition of sound for CPR feedback,
                                     leading us to refine our prototype to include a clear sequence of actions, as well as functional requirements like blinking and sound signals for each chest compression, and an overall coherent presentation of the first aid process.

                                <p>In the fourth iteration of developing, we finalized the solution by 
                                    incorporating a <strong>mind map</strong> from a first aid course, creating detailed, high-resolution A6-sized cards for each step in first aid, 
                                    including stable side position, assessing unconsciousness, and CPR. These cards were color-coded to correspond with LED lights in the solution,
                                    enhancing learnability and efficiency. We also integrated audio cues for CPR to facilitate ease of use without the need to focus on blinking lights.

                            Conducting the "Designing with  users" method was a quite challenging part during the COVID-19 lock-down, in addition to data collection and evaluations, which all were conducted over Zoom.
                             This made us aware of the significant difference in communicating over Zoom versus in person, meaning we had to adjust our communication methods when we noticed lack of understanding.
                             In return did this encouraged us to think even more creatively, pushing us to adapt innovative approaches on a short time.
                              I found this to be very educational, imparting valuable lessons that I have since applied to other projects.
