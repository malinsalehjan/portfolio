            <h7>DHIS2 - Developing a web application for a health platform</h7>
            <p> I collaborated with a team of five on this group project to develop a web application for the <strong>DHIS2 platform, one of the world's largest health management information system. </strong>
                The aim was for us to <strong>digitalize and improve</strong> workflows of "store managers", 
                to understand the practices and principles of developing such applications for <strong>platform ecosystems</strong>.

                    <h6>Process</h6>
                    <p> 
                        This was a short project where we only had 1.5 months to develop a web application for DHIS2 that met the functional and design requirements of the platform. This meant that we had to follow a strict 
                        time schedule, but still work agile in iterations in order to achieve a desirable application in time.

                    <h6>My contributions</h6>
                    <p> 
                        In this project, I collaborated in co-creating all the sketches and prototypes for the application in Figma, 
                        and was also involved in programming and developing it using HTML, CSS, and React.

                    <h2>DHIS2?</h2>

                    <div class="about-content">
                        <div class="about-text">
                            <h3>About the case</h3>
                            <p>The case we were presented with was a realistic scenario inspired by actual needs and use cases from DHIS2 users globally.
                            Our project involved developing an application for the hypothetical country "Whotopia",
                            a nation struggling with numerous diseases and a shortage of essential medicines. 
                            <br><br>This application was intended for all Whotopia's hospitals to aid in the store management of their medicine and goods inventory. 
                            Considering the current workflow, where records are maintained on paper, and focusing on the system's end users,
                             our task was to design a DHIS2 application to <strong>support the hospital store managers</strong> in efficiently tracking and managing the 
                             dispensation of medicines and goods.</p>
    
                            <h3>Technical aspects</h3>
                            <p> HTML, CSS and React were used for dynamic front-end functionality, and the DHIS2 API for efficient data management and inventory control.
                                Moreover did we use Git for code reviews, working on individual branches when choosing a task.
                            </p>

                            <h3> Design decisions</h3>
                            <p> Our goal was to seamlessly develop a smooth transition from paper to digital. For this, the DHIS2's UX library and framework helped us 
                                stay within the intented style used in this platform such as the color scheme, icons, fonts and layouts.

                                <br><br><strong>Feedback, constrains, mapping and consistensy</strong> were our main focus in order to achieve a good user experience on this site.
                                 We had various feedbacks serving understandable information for missing input, if the order went through, if the action is not possible, and information about stock predictions/habits. 
                                This was to make it easy for the user to understand the new system, and provide an explanation of how to use it.

                                    Once we reached an equal agreement on the initial sketches, we began creating high-fidelity prototypes in Figma and eventually started our implementation phase. 
                                    We initiated the implementation later than typically advised for this project, as it was important for us to achieve a shared agreement on the UI and UX design of the application,
                                     ensuring that we would not encounter disagreements at a later stage in the project.

                                    We tested the 'look and feel' of the application with a group teacher involved in this project to gather diverse perspectives on the design and identify
                                    any overlooked elements. The last requirement we implemented was training mode, made as a knowledge resource boundary for uncertain or new users.
                                    <br><br>The professor was excited about our implementation of this, noting that not many chose to implement this requirement. 
                                    However, we considered this to be the most important, as the project description indicated that store managers often lack qualifications due to 
                                    insufficient funding for employing dedicated managers.

                                This project taught me a lot, and was very educational in the case of handling various factors in such a big project, and in turning 
                                a design concept into a fully developed web application in such a short time. The challenging part was not having real users to talk and work with, which made justifying certain design choices
                                and functionalities difficult.
